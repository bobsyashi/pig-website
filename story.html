    <header><b>The Amazing Squeaky Pig: Relaxing Poam</b></header>

    <p class="poem">Entering the room of the pig there is joy and happiness, all other emotions disappear. The salmon color of the pig can “capture [our] attention while also providing a sense of calm,” (Becker).
        The sound that the pig makes also provides a calming and satisfying feeling as it sings to you. 
        This pig, although small, can make for a great squeeze toy. While squeezing and listening to the pig sing its one note lullaby, everything disappears. 
        The sight of a lake appears and a warm summer breeze blows the trees lightly. 
        The rubber pigs squeaky voice sounds like the birds chirping in the early morning. But it all disappears as soon as the rubber pig stops singing.
        Another squeeze and now the sandy beach with a salty smell is there. This pig brings unimaginable joy while squeezing it. 
        Every time the pig is squeezed pure joy and calm joyful thoughts fill the room.
