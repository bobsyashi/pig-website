    <h2 class="poem-title">The Pig Brings Joy</h2>
    <div class="poem-div">
        <p><i>Entering the room of the pig there is joy and happiness, all other emotions disappear. 
            The salmon color of the pig can “capture [the] attention while also providing a sense of calm,” (Becker).
            The sound that the pig makes also provides a calming and satisfying feeling as it sings. 
            This pig, although small, can make for a great squeeze toy. 
            While squeezing and listening to the pig sing its one note lullaby, the surroundings disappears. 
            The sight of a lake appears and a warm summer breeze blows the trees lightly. 
            The rubber pigs squeaky voice sounds like the birds chirping in the early morning. 
            But it all disappears as soon as the rubber pig stops singing.
            Another squeeze and now the sandy beach with a salty smell is there. This pig brings unimaginable joy while squeezing it. 
            Every time the pig is squeezed pure joy and calm joyful thoughts fill the room.</i>

    <h2 class="poem-title">Pigs Relaxation</h2>
    <div class="poem-div">
        <p><i>When rest and calmness of mind is needed, the rubber pig is a great way to relax. 
            One squeeze brings a smile, two bring a chuckle, and three brings a full belly laugh. 
            On tough days and unfortunate circumstances, the pig is forever there to comfort and console no matter what. 
            When needing instant joy and relaxation just pull out the squeaker. It looks like a 1930s angry cartoon train whistle. 
            Blow into the squeaker to hear the rubber pig’s beautiful relaxing voice. 
            With its salmon color and rubbery feel, the rubber pig makes a great “stuffed animal.” 
            Additionally, the rubber pig can also be an alarm clock. 
            This rubber pig can appear in dreams to relax nerves from your dreams.
            An extremely underrated aspect of the pig is how it tastes and what it represents. 
            The rubbery texture of the pig and the smell is exactly what it tastes like. 
            But the pig is a strong reminder of thick cut bacon that would be found in a 5 star restaurant. 
            The desired taste of bacon from the rubber pig is not what it tastes like.</i>
